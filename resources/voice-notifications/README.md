This smart app gives ability to make voice alerts when some events occur or mode changes

To work it needs device with `Speech Synthesis` capability (device with `speak` method that can pronounce text that was given as a param).

Sonos or obycode solutions won't work with this smart app cause they use `speak` method to get mp3 file out of text, but not to pronounce/play it.
